      <h4>Lyrics</h4>
She said, every time I close my eyes
I feel like I could disappear (disappear)
I could overflow an ocean
With the cavalcade of all my tears (all my tears)
And I know I sound dramatic
But that's just how it feels (how it feels)
She said, I'm holdin' to the notion
That I'll find something real
Yeah I just want to be wanted, oh
I could use a little love sometimes
I just need to be needed, oh
Like to know I'm crossin' someone's mind
I just want to be someone that somebody needs
I just want to be more than a drop in the sea
I just want to be
She said, I'm countin' up my karma
And I think it's time to cash it in (cash it in)
So tired of livin' in a shadow
Of a mountain of what might've been (might've been)
And I know I sound dramatic but that's just how it feels (ooh)
I've been looking for somebody to tell me that I'm real (ooh)
I just want to be wanted (oh)
I could use a little love sometimes
I just need to be needed (oh)
Like to know I'm crossin' someone's mind
I just want to be someone that somebody needs
I just want to be more than a drop in the sea
I just want to be wanted (ooh)
Oh yeah
We just want to be wanted (ooh)
Ooh
I just want to be wanted
I could use a little love sometimes
I just need to be needed
Like to know I'm crossin' someone's mind
