Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?
The universal selector is used to style every element on a page and is shown by an asterisk. The element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type. This selector is applied by simply using an element name such as p for paragraph or h1 for heading 1. Class names are shown by class="" and are also used to style elements. To select class elements, insert a dot (.) in the front of the class name in the CSS. Like the class selector, the ID allows style rules to be defined for a specific element by its unique ID. It is followed by a #.

The first color I chose was a yellow with the rgb values(251, 210, 102) and hex code #FBD266. The second color I chose was a blue-green with the rgb values(143, 176, 169) and hex code #8FB0A9. The third color I chose was a orange with the rgb values(215, 103, 53) and hex code #D76735.

I created my assignment 9 folder and added an index.html and style.css. I added the 4 main document elements and 4 meta elements to the index.html. I then added a link element in the head, linking the style.css to the index.html. I included many divs and classes in my css. I added 3 images, included text summarizing the 70's and used a color palette from the 70s.
