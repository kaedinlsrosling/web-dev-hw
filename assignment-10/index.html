        <p>I want to remind you that you do not need anyone’s permission to be yourself, and you also don’t need to conform and twist and rebrand your goal to make it more palatable for them. You don’t need to present yourself in a certain light to be loved and accepted. The people who deserve to be in your life will care about who you—the real you—actually are, even if it takes some getting used to. Even if you’re different from every other woman they know. Even if you’re different from the woman they fell in love with.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Be the kind of woman</i> you want to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Be the kind of woman</i> who is proud to be herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Be the kind of woman<i> who has so much love inside her that she won’t be tempted to change herself in order to get love from others.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Be the kind of woman</i> who focuses more on being interested than on other people thinking she’s interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Be the kind of woman</i> who laughs loudly and often.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Be the kind of woman</i> who is generous—no matter how much money is in your bank account, you have a wealth of resources to offer others.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Be the kind of woman</i> who spends a lifetime learning, because knowledge is power and those who think they know it all are often the dumbest among us.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Be the kind of woman</i> both your eleven-year-old self and your ninety-year-old self would be proud of.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Be the kind of woman</i> who shows up for her life.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Be the kind of woman</i> who understands that she was made for more.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Be the kind of woman</i> who believes that she is capable of doing amazing things in this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Be the kind of woman</i> whose own dreams make her nervous—and then go ahead and do them anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Be the kind of woman</i> who never asks permission to be herself.
