System fonts are already installed on your device. They are available in most programs we use. Web fonts are custom fonts hosted on a server. They do not have to be available on the user's device to appear. Web-Safe fonts are fonts that developers can count on being available by the system. These include font families that Windows and Mac should both have.

Fallback & font stacks cause the browser to try and load your first font. If the computer trying to load the content does not have a font matching that name, it will then try the second font, then the third font, then finally the default font of the font family you chose.

I created my assignment 10 folder and included a CSS folder and a folder for fonts and also an index file and README file. In the index file, I included the 4 main document elements and also the 4 meta elements. I added a link from the css style sheet to the index file. I included divs, classes, and ids throughout my page. I added a link to a website with information on the author of my passage and I also included the title and publishing date of my passage. I used structural and semantic elements in my passage. I used two complimentary fonts and included a fallback font for each. I set the font size, weight and style for my title.  


Adjust the spacing (leading, tracking, etc) and/or alignment of an element.
Attach a pseudo-element to an element.
Style your link element with a hover pseduo-class.
