Everything I learned in the class was relatively all new to me. I had no knowledge of what github and atom were or let alone how to use them. I also had no knowledge of all the elements and steps involved in creating a website.

I learned how to add and chose colors for the design of your website, how to insert media, such as videos, audio and images, and I also learned how to download fonts properly and incorporate them in your website.

I created my files using divs and classes. I incorporated different fonts and colors throughout my website. I added an image, a dropdown menu and also a form with a submit button. I added navigation to go between my pages. I tried to continue working with positioning but am continuing to struggle with placing certain items in specific places.
