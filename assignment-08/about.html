     <h2>Napkin Folding</h2>
   </div>
   <p>I choose this project because it's effortless, but also added decoration to a dull, boring dinner table while also serving a purpose.</p>
   <p>This project is unique to me because family dinners are significant in my family, and being able to put a little extra effort into them means a lot to me.</p>
