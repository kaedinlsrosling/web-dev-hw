It got a little more difficult to me when we incorporated forms and all the input elements. It seems to me that the inputs are interchangeable and kind of confuse me. Its interesting how there are all kinds of different ways to style pages.

The only thing that I'm nervous about as we begin learning CSS is managing all of the different ways you can style HTML and remembering how to properly code those styles. But I am also excited to learn the different ways you can style HTML and how you can add a lot of detail and effects to a website.  

My work cycle for this assignment included creating my folder with 3 html pages and my README file. In every html page I added the main document elements and the meta elements. I also created a few style elements to tie the html pages together. Then I added nav elements to each page to link them to each other. I added my instructions and also elements such as a table, list and a couple images. Finally I updated my README file.
