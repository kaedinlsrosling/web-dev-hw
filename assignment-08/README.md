Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

The only thing that I'm nervous about as we begin learning CSS is managing all of the different ways you can style HTML and remembering how to properly code those styles. But I am also excited to learn the different ways you can style HTML and how you can add a lot of detail and effects to a website.  

My work cycle for this assignment included creating my folder with 3 html pages and my README file. In every html page I added the main document elements and the meta elements. I also created a few style elements to tie the html pages together. Then I added nav elements to each page to link them to each other. I added my instructions and also elements such as a table, list and a couple images. Finally I updated my README file.
