Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

My work cycle for this assignment included creating my folder with 3 html pages and my README file. In every html page I added the main document elements and the meta elements. I also created a few style elements to tie the html pages together. Then I added nav elements to each page to link them to each other. I added elements such as a table, list and a couple images. Finally I updated my README file.
