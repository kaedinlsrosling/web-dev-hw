I found a lot of text entry forms that are used to log into an account to use a certain service that contains your personal information. I found this type of form on The University of Montana website and other sites such as Facebook.

Another example of a text form is where you enter certain information such as your name or phone number, an example of a selection form is used for multiple choice options such as making an appointment online, and an example of a button input is used to submit information or to move to another page such as a shopping cart on a website.

During this work cycle, I created my assignment 6 folder with all of the proper document and meta elements. I searched a popular establishment in Missoula and added a table with their operating hours and happy hour and I also included their address, phone number and an email link to contact them. Finally I created a form for customers to use to sign-in with their information.
